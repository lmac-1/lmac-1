## About me

Hi, I'm Lucy 👋🏻. I'm a British self-taught developer living in Cali, Colombia and started my coding journey in May 2020. 

With so much free time living through [one of the longest quarantines in the world](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-09/colombia-six-month-coronavirus-lockdown-price-to-pay/12855242), I decided to take CS50X, a free "Introduction to Computer Science" course from the University of Harvard, and completely fell in love with programming. 

Since then, I've worked through the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certifications on FreeCodeCamp and also completed CS50x's follow on course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". 

Right now I'm learning React 🤓
